## 🚀 How to Set Up Custom Domain for GitHub Pages

To use the custom domain `rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.github.io`, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Using a Custom Subdomain (Recommended)

1. **Register a domain** (if you want a completely custom URL like `rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.com`)
   - Purchase from providers like Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.
   
2. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on **Settings** (top menu)
   - Scroll to **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
   - Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
   - Under **Branch**, select your main branch and **`/ (root)`**
   - Under **Custom domain**, enter: `rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.github.io` (or your purchased domain)
   - Click **Save**
   
3. **Configure DNS** (if using your own domain):
   - Add a CNAME record pointing to `rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.github.io`
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

### Option 2: Simple GitHub Pages Setup

If you prefer to keep using GitHub's subdomain:

1. Go to Settings → Pages in your repository
2. Select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Choose your main branch and root folder
4. The CNAME file will automatically configure the custom domain
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
6. Visit: **https://rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.github.io/**

**Note:** The CNAME file in this repository is pre-configured for the custom URL.
