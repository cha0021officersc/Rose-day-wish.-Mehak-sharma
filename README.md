2. Click on **Settings** (top menu)
3. Scroll to **Pages** (in the left sidebar under "Code and automation")
4. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Under **Branch**, select your main branch and **`/ (root)`**

## 🎨 Want a Custom URL Without Your Username?

GitHub Pages URLs include your username by default. To get a cleaner URL like `rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.com`, you have these options:

### Option 1: Purchase a Custom Domain (Recommended for Clean URLs)

1. **Buy a domain** from providers like:
   - Namecheap (~$10/year)
   - GoDaddy
   - Porkbun
   - Squarespace Domains (formerly Google Domains)
   
   Examples you could buy:
   - `rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.com`
   - `mehaksharma-roseday.com`
   - `roseday-mehak.com`

2. **Configure DNS** at your domain provider:
   - Add a CNAME record: `www` → `cha0021officersc.github.io`
   - Or add A records pointing to GitHub's IPs:
     - `185.199.108.153`
     - `185.199.109.153`
     - `185.199.110.153`
     - `185.199.111.153`

3. **Update GitHub Pages Settings:**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Under "Custom domain", enter your domain (e.g., `rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.com`)
   - Click Save
   - Enable "Enforce HTTPS" (after DNS propagates)

4. **Create CNAME file** in your repository:
   - Create a file named `CNAME` (no extension)
   - Add your domain name (e.g., `rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.com`)

### Option 2: Use a Free Subdomain Service

Services like:
- **is-a.dev** - Free subdomains for developers
- **js.org** - Free subdomains for JavaScript projects
- **netlify.app** - Free hosting with custom subdomains

These let you get custom URLs without purchasing a domain.

### Option 3: Create a GitHub Organization (Advanced)

To get a URL like `rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.github.io`:
1. Create a GitHub organization named `rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma`
2. Transfer or recreate this repository under that organization
3. Name the repository `rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.github.io`
4. The site will be at `https://rose-day-wish-mehak-sharma.github.io/`

**Note:** GitHub Pages URLs follow the pattern `username.github.io/repository-name`. The exact format `github.io/rose-day-wish-MEHAK-SHARMA` (without a username prefix) isn't possible with GitHub Pages alone - you would need a custom domain.
